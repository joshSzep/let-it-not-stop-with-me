**Let It Not Stop With Me — Field Note**
**January 19, 2026**

This is a record, not a reflection.

After couples therapy, we drove to Griffith Park with Wolfya. In the car, I glanced over and saw Koko watching him with a big, unselfconscious smile. She was not signaling affection. She was simply loving him. Wolfya was not responding. He was just being himself. The love existed without negotiation.

The warmth between them filled the car. It felt like sitting near a fireplace during an Ohio winter. Not excitement. Not relief. Sustaining heat. The kind that does not demand attention but keeps you alive.

I did nothing to earn this moment. I did not improve it. I did not explain it. I witnessed it, and that was enough.

This matters because I have a pattern of forgetting what connection actually feels like. I replace it with effort, analysis, urgency, or appetite. I tell myself that love must be intense, fragile, or proven to count. This moment contradicts that story.

Connection, when I am present, is quiet. It happens in motion, between destinations, before anything “important” occurs. It leaves my body calmly tired instead of agitated or empty.

I am writing this so it does not stop with me.

Not the hike.
Not the burgers.
Not the day.

The warmth.
The safety.
The fact that love was already there, burning steadily, whether I noticed it or not.

If I later claim I am disconnected, frantic, or starved for meaning, this note stands as evidence to the contrary.
