# Things I Forget Then Remember

This is evidence. It’s for me when I’m clear enough to rationalize, or avoidant enough to disappear.

- Feeling better does not mean I’m fixed.
- “This will last” is a mood, not a fact.
- “It will no longer be difficult” is usually the start of trouble.
- Staying up all night is not productivity for me; it’s a symptom.
- “Important with a capital I” is a manic smell.
- “It must be done immediately” is often the lie that buys me permission.
- Sleep is not something I can pay back later.
- There is interest on sleep debt, and it compounds.
- When I feel like I’m broken, I’m often just underslept.
- Avoidance feels like relief and behaves like gasoline.
- Avoidance clears space for anxiety and cravings.
- Not applying myself at work is often the first domino.
- “I’ve earned the slack” can be the beginning of a slide.
- Slack turns into avoidance faster than I admit.
- Secrecy is the disease, not me.
- When secrecy shows up, I’m becoming a puppet.
- I don’t want to be a puppet.
- The fastest way out of puppet mode is self-care.
- A shower changes my state more than my mind wants to remember.
- “I don’t stink” is not a reason; it’s a dodge.
- I avoid hygiene to avoid transition.
- I sometimes cling to the subtle pleasure of suffering.
- That pleasure buys me an escape from responsibility.
- That escape costs me dignity.
- When dignity drops, I look for escape.
- Distraction is a drug-shaped behavior.
- Some music is a fantasy canvas for permission.
- The “cool rebellious drug user” fantasy is permission dressed up as identity.
- Permission leads to disconnection.
- Disconnection is the danger.
- When I disconnect, values feel distant and people feel far.
- I am not alone.
- I don’t have to carry urges by myself.
- Recruiting help increases my ability to choose something else.
- Bringing urges into the light makes them scatter.
- Keeping urges private makes the spiral easier.
- “I’m protecting them from worry” is usually a cover story.
- That cover story puts me in a cage match with myself.
- Urges can be short.
- Moods can be short.
- “This won’t end” is a feeling, not a prediction.
- I am alive.
- I tried to stop being alive once.
- Depression can feel permanent and still pass.
- Practice works.
- I can verify that practice works by showing up once.
- Skipping practice reliably makes me worse.
- When I skip, I get more depressed.
- When I skip, I stop caring for my body.
- When I skip, I stop functioning.
- Sangha is a reconnection event.
- “Today isn’t the right day” is often the day.
- I don’t have to be doing well to show up.
- It’s not N-O. It’s O-N.
- “I deserve what I want (more than what I need)” is a trap.
- Not brushing my teeth is not my true form.
- I’ve already paid for neglect with my body.
- I want to preserve what I have left.
