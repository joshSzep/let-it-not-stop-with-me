Let It Not Stop With Me — Field Note
2026-01-20

Time window: 9:45am–10:30am.

I drive home.
I enter the house.
I sit at my computer.
I work on my computer.
I drink about one cup of coffee.

I do not eat.
I do not stretch.
I do not walk.

I do not text.
I do not call.
I do not message.
Koko sleeps.

Breathing feels normal.
Heart rate feels normal.
There is muscle tension in my shoulders.
My stomach feels loose.
There is no pressure in my head.
