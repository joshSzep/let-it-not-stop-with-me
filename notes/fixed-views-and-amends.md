I went to Friday night Sangha with Ward.

His talk was about fixed views. Not in an abstract way. In the way that quietly slips past your defenses and lands somewhere lower. He spoke about how certainty can masquerade as care, how righteousness can wear the costume of practice, how even good intentions can harden into something clenched.

I listened. I nodded. I felt myself relax.

And then something from the past surfaced.

Months ago, maybe longer, I had messaged someone from Sangha. Matt. I don’t remember exactly when. I remember the tone though. He had been making assertions about the mindfulness trainings, speaking with a confidence that rubbed me the wrong way. It felt prescriptive. Fixed. More like doctrine than practice.

I reached out to challenge him.

At the time, I told myself I was being thoughtful. Respectful. Clear. And on the surface, I was. The words were measured. There was no heat. No insult.

But tonight, sitting there listening to Ward, I saw the root I hadn’t wanted to look at.

I was defensive.

Not defensive because I was wrong about the substance. But defensive because something in me felt threatened. Something about the way he spoke activated my own attachment to how I understand practice, how I locate humility, how I define “right view” by insisting there is none.

I wasn’t just offering perspective. I was protecting an identity.

Time passed. Life moved. The exchange faded into the background. Until tonight.

The realization wasn’t dramatic. It was quiet. Almost mundane. Just a clear sense: *I owe him an amends.*

Not an apology for having a view. Not a reversal. An amends for how tightly I held it. For speaking from a place of clenching instead of curiosity.

I wanted to message him. To say it cleanly. To own my side and leave the rest alone.

I couldn’t find the chat.

No thread. No open channel. Nothing obvious. The path to repair wasn’t there.

At first, that stirred discomfort. A familiar itch. The desire to complete, to resolve, to be “done.” I noticed how easily even amends can become another form of grasping.

So I stopped.

I let the amends happen internally.

I named it to myself. I acknowledged the defensiveness without justifying it. I released the need to be right, and the need to be seen as right. I made the commitment quietly: *next time, I will speak more softly.*

If the opportunity to say this to him arises in the future, I will take it. If it doesn’t, I won’t force it.

Not all amends require an audience. Some are about changing the pattern at the root.

The practice, I’m learning, isn’t avoiding fixed views. It’s noticing when I’m gripping one, and choosing — again and again — to loosen my hand.

Let this not stop with me.
