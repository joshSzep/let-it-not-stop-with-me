Let This Not End With Me — Field Note
2026-01-23

Morning after.

My head feels a little swollen.
There is tension in the back of my skull.
My eyes are a little dry.
I feel like I weigh 20 lb more somehow.

I fell asleep around 4:00am.
I woke up at 7:15am, before my alarm.

The day before:

I woke up earlier than intended.
I handled my morning routine.
I went into the office.

I had meetings all day.
They were expensive.
My social battery drained.

I ate lunch alone at my desk.

I left the office around 2pm and went back to work at home.
At 6pm, I drove Koko to work.
I deposited some cash at the bank.

On the drive home, I almost bought nitrous.
I didn’t.
I talked it through instead.

I worked.
I kept working.

About an hour before picking Koko up, I decided I deserved the nitrous.

When Koko called, I hid it.
I picked her up.
I came home.

I worked more.
I stayed grinding.
Copilot did most of the lifting.
I kept slamming my head against the problem anyway.

I waited until Koko went to bed around 3am.
Then I finished the nitrous.
I slept on the couch.

What was missing was reward.

I believed I had earned it for working hard and staying clean for two weeks solid.

When I used it, the change was immediate.
Body numb.
Mind silenced.
Time distorted.
It hit like a train.

After it was gone, emptiness showed up.
Not the Buddhist kind.
I wanted to have not done the nitrous.
I also wanted to have not run out of it.

This morning, I don’t believe nitrous is a reward.

That voice was not rebellion.
It was exhaustion wearing a leather jacket.

I had been listening to drug-filled hip hop all evening.
I was amped on the fantasy of a rebellious, shameless, druggie hero.

The real reward I skipped was quieter.
Time with Koko and Wolfya.
Laughing with a friend.

Boundary:

When I am low on sleep, I do not get to decide what I “deserve.”
