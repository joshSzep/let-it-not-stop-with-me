# Author Intent — Let It Not Stop With Me

This note is for me, not for readers.

## Why this book must exist

Lately I have a pattern of integration: more awareness, more openness, more honesty about the cycles I’m moving through. Things still loop, but I’m noticing sooner. The lag time is shrinking. The momentum feels real and fragile. I don’t want that to disappear into vagueness or amnesia.

I’m writing to leave myself evidence. Not slogans—evidence. Pages that remember what I forget: how quickly I can rewrite the past, how convincing I can sound when I’m drifting, how easily I can confuse insight with performance.

This book is an attempt to not let what passes through me stop with me. Not because I have answers, but because I have lived texture: the small, ordinary moments where I either participate in something larger than myself or I contract into appetite and isolation; the moments where I act from compassion instead of ego; the moments where I don’t use even though I want to.

## What this book is

A living manuscript written from inside recovery and practice, not after it.

It is a witnessing: what I did, what happened, what I thought it meant, and what later revised that meaning. Zen and the 12 Steps appear here because they are in my days. They are not presented as systems I can explain cleanly. They are friction and contact: what I encountered, what I resisted, what I tried, what it cost, what shifted (for now).

It is allowed to be non-linear. I can return. I can contradict myself. I can be back at Step 1 after sounding like I wasn’t. The engine is not “progress.” The engine is what becomes clearer over time—and what refuses to become clear.

## What this book is not

Not a recovery manual.
Not a Buddhist primer.
Not a synthesis that resolves Zen and the Steps.
Not a motivational book.
Not redemption porn.
Not a story with a clean arc.
Not a guide, map, framework, or set of remedies.

And most importantly: not an authority stance.

I’m early. I’m not a Zen master. I can’t describe the Steps without a cheat sheet. I’m not better than anyone else (including earlier versions of me). If I start sounding like a teacher, I’m already lying.

## Who it’s for

One kind of reader: someone in recovery who is frustrated.

Someone with relapses, rewound steps, messy returns. Someone who has tried meditation and wondered if they were “doing it wrong.” Someone who feels broken in a way no one else is broken. Someone who feels stuck—not like quicksand on the outside, but like a watch that needs winding on the inside.

If this lands, page 1 feels like being seen. The last page feels like a little hope—not the kind that pretends it’s easy, but the kind that makes continuing feel possible.

## Who it’s not for

Not for the reader who wants clean answers to unclean questions.
Not for someone looking for a savior, a guru, or a tidy framework.

I’m not trying to give anybody false hope. I’m not trying to make this sound simple, efficient, or solved.

## What success looks like

Sobriety. Plain and simple.

If this manuscript helps me stay honest—if it keeps my feet near the ground when my mind wants to float off into explanation—then it is worth writing even if nobody praises it.

## Guardrails (for me)

If the writing gets heady and philosophical without lived proof, that’s a warning sign.

If the voice gets prescriptive—if I start handing out frameworks—I’ve drifted.

If I claim I’m healed, done, or complete, I’m probably back in the old trance.

This should not be easy. It should be worthwhile.
