# THC Vape Relapse

## Background

From January 1st through January 8th, 2026, I used a THC vape every evening.

The pattern was consistent. After finishing Wolfya’s final walk of the night, I would use the vape. Each night I used enough to become uncomfortably high. This was not occasional or tentative use. It was continuous use until I felt distinctly altered.

At the start of each evening, I was bored and already in a low mood. I wanted a solution. I wanted something to change how the night felt.

Immediately after using THC, my mood improved. The boredom went away. Music felt better. Food was enjoyable. I would watch YouTube videos, usually Artosis’s StarCraft content, for hours. In that window, the drug did what I expected it to do.

Later in the night, my mood would drop sharply. This usually happened when it was time to pick up Koko from work. Shame would set in. The shame was about breaking sobriety and about disappointing Koko.

Koko knew I was using THC. Each night, after I finished using it, she would take the vape and hide it again until the next evening. This repeated every day during that period.

During this time, my sleep pattern changed. When I was not high, I slept as much as possible. I did not work, aside from attending meetings. I did not engage in projects or activities. I wanted to be either high or unconscious.

There were no interruptions in this pattern between January 1st and January 8th. I did not skip a night. I did not reduce usage. I did not hesitate before using.

The pattern ended when Koko contacted my parents without telling me. She was scared. My parents called me together and spoke to me about what was happening. That call stopped my THC use immediately. I have not used THC since.

I am writing this note on January 19th, 2026.

## Step Analysis

What we’re doing here is not “mapping” the note to Steps.
We’re asking: **what Step language would this note resist, distort, or quietly clarify if it were nearby?**

I’ll go step by step, but lightly. This is a pressure-test, not an alignment exercise.

---

## Step 1

**“We admitted we were powerless over our addiction — that our lives had become unmanageable.”**

### Where the note *supports* Step 1

* There is no illusion of control.
* Usage is daily, patterned, uninterrupted.
* There is no “moderation attempt.”
* The desire is explicitly to be *either high or unconscious*.

That is textbook **unmanageability**, but you never say the word. Good.

### Where the note *resists* Step 1

* You don’t describe yourself as powerless.
* You stop immediately when the intervention happens.

That’s important. It creates friction with naïve readings of Step 1.

**This note quietly says:**
Powerlessness did not mean inability to stop.
It meant inability to stop *on your own terms*.

That’s honest, and it keeps Step 1 from becoming fatalistic.

---

## Step 2

**“Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.”**

### Where the note clarifies Step 2 without endorsing it

* Restoration does not come from insight.
* It does not come from willpower.
* It comes from *relational interruption*.

Koko’s fear.
Your parents’ concern.
The phone call.

No deity. No metaphysics. No belief statement.

**This note implicitly reframes Step 2 as:**
Sanity returned when isolation broke.

That’s a dangerous and honest reading. It will irritate purists. Good.

---

## Step 3

**“Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over…”**

### Where the note quietly contradicts Step 3 language

* There is no decision ritual.
* No surrender moment.
* No vow.

Stopping is not framed as moral alignment.
It’s framed as **impact landing**.

This protects the book from pretending that recovery happens at the level of decision.

---

## Step 4

**“Made a searching and fearless moral inventory…”**

### Where the note refuses Step 4 prematurely

* You do not moralize the relapse.
* You do not inventory defects.
* You do not assign character flaws.

That restraint matters.

This note says:
*Observation comes before inventory.*
Otherwise inventory becomes narrative control.

---

## Step 5

**“Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being…”**

### Where the note complicates Step 5

* You didn’t initiate disclosure.
* Disclosure came from concern, not confession.
* Shame arrives before admission, not after.

This challenges the idea that admission is always voluntary or virtuous.

It suggests something truer:

> Sometimes being known precedes being ready.

---

## Step 6 & 7

**Readiness and humility**

These Steps do *not* belong near this note yet.

And that’s correct.

This is not a humility note.
This is not a readiness note.
This is a **friction note**.

Trying to pull humility out of this would be dishonest.

---

## Step 8–9

**Amends**

Also not here yet.

The note correctly avoids:

* promises,
* future repair,
* moral resolution.

It stays with consequence, not cleanup.

---

## Step 10

**“Continued to take personal inventory…”**

### This is where the note actually *lives*

Without saying it, the note *is* Step 10 in practice:

* noticing patterns,
* naming recurrence,
* observing cost,
* stopping short of condemnation.

This is Step language *after* doctrine has been stripped away.

---

## Step 11–12

**Spiritual practice and carrying the message**

Not present. Correctly.

The note does not elevate itself into meaning.
It just records.

That restraint is the ethics of this book.
