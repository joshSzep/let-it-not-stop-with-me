# THC Vape Relapse

From January 1st through January 8th, 2026, I used a THC vape every evening.

The pattern was consistent. After finishing Wolfya’s final walk of the night, I would use the vape. Each night I used enough to become uncomfortably high. This was not occasional or tentative use. It was continuous use until I felt distinctly altered.

At the start of each evening, I was bored and already in a low mood. I wanted a solution. I wanted something to change how the night felt.

Immediately after using THC, my mood improved. The boredom went away. Music felt better. Food was enjoyable. I would watch YouTube videos, usually Artosis’s StarCraft content, for hours. In that window, the drug did what I expected it to do.

Later in the night, my mood would drop sharply. This usually happened when it was time to pick up Koko from work. Shame would set in. The shame was about breaking sobriety and about disappointing Koko.

Koko knew I was using THC. Each night, after I finished using it, she would take the vape and hide it again until the next evening. This repeated every day during that period.

During this time, my sleep pattern changed. When I was not high, I slept as much as possible. I did not work, aside from attending meetings. I did not engage in projects or activities. I wanted to be either high or unconscious.

There were no interruptions in this pattern between January 1st and January 8th. I did not skip a night. I did not reduce usage. I did not hesitate before using.

The pattern ended when Koko contacted my parents without telling me. She was scared. My parents called me together and spoke to me about what was happening. That call stopped my THC use immediately. I have not used THC since.

I am writing this note on January 19th, 2026.
