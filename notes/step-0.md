# Step 0: Rock Bottom

The last time I had a cocaine binge ended on Sunday, May 11, 2025: Mother's Day.

That morning I was starting my third day in a row without sleep. I had been binging on cocaine for days. I was exhausted, anxious, irritable, and emotionally raw. I don't remember what I was even doing those days, aside from drugs, but I do remember the phone call.

I called momma to wish her a happy Mother's Day. We had a pleasant conversation. I didn't think that she knew I was high. I was wrong, of course, but cocaine always made me wrong about such things. Then we arrived at the topic of her diet.

My mother is diabetic - type 2. At that point in time she was dealing with stomach issues that had been persisting for weeks. She told me about how good a relationship she had with her MD. She told me an anecdote about an appointment and how they talked about Indian food which her MD (who is of Indian descent) and how good it was. Something about good bedside manner. 

I exploded. Let me explain.

I love my mother. I want the best for her, and I want her to survive for as long as possible. I want her to be cared for by the best, most competent, most professional MD I could theorize. This was not that. This was a friend. 

I kept telling her she needed a new doctor. A better doctor. She kept insisting he was a good doctor. I tried to explain different ways. I walked her through what an appointment with my MD was like. I asked her what a typical appointment with her MD was like. I highlighted the differences. I pleaded. Nothing was getting through.

I became frustrated.

"HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR FUCKING DOCTOR NOT YOUR FUCKING FRIEND!" I screamed at her. I then hung up the phone and didn't answer when she tried to call me back, probably confused beyond reason, because I wanted to underscore my emotional intensity to try to break through her denial about her doctor.

My roommate was home and heard the whole thing. He suggested that I had gone too far, which made me blow up at him next. I screamed at him that I know this made him uncomfortable, but I didn't care. I was trying to save my mother's life. I was trying to save her from a bad doctor. I was trying to save her from herself.

That's when the tears started. I was so exhausted, so strung out, so emotionally raw that I just started crying. I cried for what felt like hours. My roommate sat with me and comforted me. I don't remember much of what he said, but I do remember that it helped.

That was not the last time I used cocaine, relapses are part of the process, but it was the last time I had a binge. That was my rock bottom. After that, I started to get serious about recovery. I immediately flushed all the rest of my cocaine down the drain (much to my roomate's chagrin). I let myself drink a glass of water, take my nighttime meds, and go to sleep.

I woke the next day and reflected on what had happened. I realized that my mother's doctor was not the problem. The problem was me. I was the one who was high, strung out, and emotionally unstable. I was the one who needed help. I was the one who needed to get clean.

That was the moment I began to suspect that my certainty was not the same thing as care.

I am writing this note on January 19th, 2026. As of today I have been sober from all drugs (not alcohol, not nicotine, not caffeine) for 12 days. My last relapse was a THC vape. I don't remember the exact date I last used cocaine, sometime in early December 2025. But that is a story for another time. For now, I am committed to recovery, and I am committed to writing this book as part of that process.
