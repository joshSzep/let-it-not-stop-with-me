**Let It Not Stop With Me — Field Note**
**January 20, 2026**

This is a record, not a reflection.

Today I went to the smoke shop for nicotine vapes.

It was midday.

I took a break from work to get gas. My tank was near empty. I was also down to my last vape from the last time I stocked up, and the weather was nice, so I extended the drive and went to the smoke shop.

I was in a decent mood, but tired in the way tired becomes porous.

Before I arrived, the thought showed up: *Nitrous would be nice.*

That surprised me. Usually that craving comes when I feel bad. This time it came when I felt good. Or maybe it came because I felt *too* good and my inhibition was looser than I wanted to admit.

I love nitrous.

It does not love me back. It leaves me broke, wobbly, ashamed, embarrassed.

Inside the shop, I walked past the shelf and looked. The hit came hard—an impulse with the confidence of a command.

And then something else happened.

I noticed myself calculating: Do I have enough headroom on the credit card that doesn’t get seen? The secret card.

That was the line.

Not the shelf. Not the product. The calculation.

Because one secret is never one secret for me. One secret is a pattern of secrecy. And that pattern is how “just one” turns into days I can’t account for, money I can’t explain, and a private little life I have to defend.

So I did the only thing that worked in that moment.

I changed where I looked.

I forced my eyes forward. I kept them on the shopkeeper. Friendly. Smiling. Present. I stuck to the mission: buy four vapes.

I talked.

Not a confession. Just ordinary conversation. Enough contact to keep my mouth from forming the extra sentence.

I paid.

I left.

In the car, the urge didn’t turn into fireworks. It turned into breath. I noticed myself breathing. Relief came first, and a small spike of pride after it.

I made it.

I did not tell anyone afterward.

I didn’t think of it as hiding. I didn’t do anything “bad.” But I notice that this is also how secrecy stays alive: it doesn’t always announce itself. Sometimes it just says nothing.

What I want to remember is simple.

If I buy nitrous, I lose self-respect.

Not as an abstract moral idea.

As a concrete, immediate problem. Because if I buy it, I either use it in the car, or I stash it, or I bring it home. All options bend me toward the same place: disconnection.

I have held this line before.

Last Sunday I drove past this same shop with a huge craving and did not stop. I turned it into anger and kept driving. I even flipped the building off like it could understand me.

Today I held it differently. Quieter. Less dramatic. More human.

The sentence that helped was blunt and true:

*You have done this before. You can do this again.*

I am writing this now because even writing about it stirs the craving back up. That is part of the terrain.

The point is not that I felt nothing.

The point is that I did not obey.

I held the line.
