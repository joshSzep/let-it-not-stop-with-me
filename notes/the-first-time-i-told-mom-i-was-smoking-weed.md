# The First Time I Told My Mother I Was Smoking Weed

Thanksgiving. Far eastern Oklahoma. The kind of rural that still feels like a choice someone keeps making.

My granny’s place sat in the dark like it had always been there. The roads around it didn’t have sidewalks. They didn’t need them.

That night my mom and I went for a walk up toward the old airstrip.

I remembered the airstrip from childhood the way you remember a photograph you’ve looked at too many times: fixed, clean, and brighter than it ever was.

As a kid I used to stand out there and see the Milky Way like a splatter of milk across an obsidian surface. I had come back expecting it to be waiting for me.

It wasn’t.

It was cold—not dramatic, just honest. Cold enough that you notice your breath and the small parts of your body you’ve been ignoring.

We carried flashlights. Each of us had one. Two cones of light moving over gravel and winter grass.

The sky was disappointing.

Not because it was ugly, but because it didn’t match my memory. There were more houses now. More people. More light. Sixteen years of little additions that didn’t feel like much until you tried to see something far away.

I was twenty-five.

My parents lived in Canal Fulton, Ohio. I lived across the country in Austin, Texas. We were together because it was Thanksgiving and because my granny was the gravitational center of that side of the family.

I had been hiding something from my parents for months.

That sentence still feels strange to write. My parents and I have always been open with each other. We have always talked. I’ve always believed the trust between us was a kind of weather—reliable, ordinary, always there.

But there was this one thing.

I had started smoking weed. At first it was social—something I picked up from a girl I was dating in Austin. I smoked when I visited her. Then I wanted it when I wasn’t with her. Then I was buying it from her. Then it was mine.

Weed made me feel happy, I thought, in a time when happy was rare.

It made food taste better.

It made music sound better.

It made jokes funnier.

It comforted me.

And I kept it to myself.

Not because I was trying to be a liar, but because I didn’t know what it meant yet, and I didn’t want to try to say it from Austin, over the phone.

On that walk, under that smaller sky, I felt the weight of the silence.

If I kept hiding this, it would become a practice. And if I turned hiding into a practice, eventually I would lose the trust I’d spent my whole life building. A worry that materialized into a truth later in my life when secrecy became a habit I couldn’t break.

So I told her.

“There’s something I have to tell you,” I said. “I started smoking weed, on the reg.”

I expected alarm. Disappointment. A lecture.

Instead she said, casually, as if I’d told her I’d started drinking coffee:

“Oh, me and your father have been trying to kick that for a long time.”

For a second I couldn’t move the sentence through my head.

My parents?

Trying to quit?

I went quiet. I think I stopped walking for a beat.

Then: “I didn’t know you guys smoked.”

She said something like, “Oh yeah. Don’t you remember the smell around the campfires?”

And it was as if a trapdoor opened.

Memories came up from a place I didn’t know I’d buried them.

The smell of weed smoke around a campfire.

A childhood moment of finding their bong and not knowing what it was, just knowing I wasn’t supposed to touch it.

It wasn’t a movie montage. It was more like my body recognizing something before my mind caught up.

The shock moved into closeness.

Not comfort. Not reassurance. Something simpler: I saw my parents more as people.

Less pristine.

Less perfect.

More complicated.

And I felt an ugly kind of happiness—ugly because it’s hard to defend now, but real because it was true then.

I had found a new activity we could share.

Then, almost immediately, worry arrived.

Because my mom’s tone was a shrug.

No warning.

No advice.

No boundary.

Just a small admission tossed into the cold air like it didn’t weigh anything.

And with that shrug came a thought I can still hear, blunt under the disappointing sky:

I’m going to be like them.

I don’t remember the rest of that trip clearly. I remember the long tail of it.

Every time I have been around my parents since then, weed has been an activity we have shared. And I haven't been around them since quitting. Maybe that will change someday.

Sometimes I look back at that night and want to make it into a clean origin story: the moment secrecy broke, the moment I was initiated, the moment the family myth changed.

But the truth is smaller and stranger.

A cold walk.

Two flashlights.

A sky that didn’t match my memory.

A confession that wasn’t met with alarm.

A surprise that rearranged my picture of who my parents were.

And the first quiet worry that I had stepped onto a path that might not let me step off.
