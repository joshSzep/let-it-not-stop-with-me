# Engagement, Not Addiction

2026-01-21

I woke up late, but not rushed. There was just enough time to move through the morning without panic if I stayed present. Fresh shirt. Bathroom. Helping Koko shift from the couch to the bed. Wolfya fed, medicated, walked. Coffee. Morning meds. Laptop open.

The work grabbed me fast today. A real problem. One with texture. Something that pushed back. I felt alert, steady, interested. Not frantic. Not scattered. Just in it.

There were interruptions. Feedback from Monica. A demo coming up. A bug that turned out to be a seam instead of a collapse. CamelCase, snake_case. Fixable. Elegant, even. I let Copilot do the mechanical parts while I held the shape of the solution. That felt good. Calm. Capable.

At some point I noticed the feeling I always notice on days like this.
The question forming quietly in the background.

Am I addicted to this?

I didn’t answer it yet. I kept working.

Lunch came. I stopped. Shrimp po’boy. A beer while waiting. Starbucks for Koko. Back home to her moving around the apartment, cleaning in that unselfconscious way. I ate. Watched Artosis cast a clean ZvP. Took supplements. My body settled instead of protesting.

Back to work. Reviews. Mentorship. Learning TypeScript edges I hadn’t seen before. Fixing things that made sense to fix. Setting other things down on purpose.

Later, a walk with Wolfya. Groceries with Koko at Hannam Market. Sashimi for dinner. Sangha. Sitting quietly with other people who know what it’s like to mistake intensity for truth.

After sangha, I walked Wolfya again. The night air helped. Back home. More work, but different now. Slower. Mechanical. Not chasing anything.

That’s when the question came back, clearer this time.

If I stopped right now, would I still feel like myself?

The answer surprised me by how easily it arrived.

Yes.

Because today, work didn’t take me away from my life. It sat inside it.

I stepped away without bargaining.
I ate without guilt.
I showed up for my dog, my wife, my practice.
I questioned the work when it stopped making sense instead of forcing it forward.

Addiction shrinks my world. I know that feeling.
It tunnels my vision. It makes everything else optional.

Today felt like the opposite.
The work expanded outward and touched other things without consuming them.

The danger for me isn’t working hard.
It’s forgetting that work isn’t the only place where effort turns into meaning.

Today, it wasn’t the only place.
It was just one place among several that held.

Today wasn’t a warning sign.
It was a data point.

I want to remember the difference.
