**Let It Not Stop With Me**

I broke my left ankle around 2:30am in Ohio while staying with my parents.

I had been drinking all night at bars. When I got home, I needed to walk Wolfya. He was off leash. He saw something and ran. I ran after him.

I did not see the cement ditch. I stepped over the edge and landed hard on my left foot. I do not think I fully fell over. The pain was immediate and intense, but I did not know it was broken. I kept moving anyway.

I made it across a couple of lawns before the pain became unbearable. I lay down on the lawn. It was cold. The ground was moist. I was worried about Wolfya. I could not keep moving. I did not intend to fall asleep.

I woke up around 6am on the front lawn. Wolfya was barking at a neighbor across the street who was getting up for work. He had stayed with me all night. I could not stand. I knew then that my ankle was broken.

I called out to the neighbor to ask him to call an ambulance. I also asked if he had a light. I had cigarettes but had lost my lighter. He did not approach me.

The police and an ambulance arrived about fifteen minutes later. Wolfya was barking at the police. I was emotional and kept asking them not to shoot my dog. I do not think that was ever a real risk, but I was not clear headed. They restrained Wolfya and took him back to my parents’ house. The paramedics loaded me into the ambulance.

This was the clearest moment of my alcoholism.
