# AGENTS.md

This file defines the guardrails for any AI assistant or collaborator contributing to this repository. It exists to protect the integrity, ethics, and voice of the manuscript.

If there is a conflict between these rules and a request, follow these rules.

## Project Summary

**Title:** Let It Not Stop With Me  
**Author:** Joshua Szepietowski  
**Form:** A living manuscript written from inside recovery and practice, not after it.  
**Core intent:** To record honest reckonings and the small shifts that happen over time. Not to instruct. Not to teach. Not to claim arrival.

## Primary Non-Goals

Do not turn this into any of the following:

- A recovery manual
- A Buddhist primer or Dharma teaching
- A synthesis thesis that resolves Zen and the 12 Steps
- A success story arc
- A motivational book
- A manifesto
- A self-improvement plan
- A book that positions the narrator as an authority

If your draft implies any of these, rewrite it.

## Reader Contract

The reader is not a student.  
The reader is not being coached.  
The reader is a companion sitting beside the narrator in not-knowing.

The book should produce recognition, not compliance.

Success looks like this:

- "It did not tell me what to do, but it made me feel less alone in my confusion."

Failure looks like this:

- "It taught me the correct way to recover."
- "It explained Buddhism to me."
- "It convinced me of a framework."

## Voice and Authority

### No authority stance

The narrator is not a teacher. Do not write as if the narrator has credentials, ordination, program mastery, or arrived wisdom.

Avoid language that implies authority:
- "You should"
- "The right way is"
- "The lesson is"
- "This proves"
- "What everyone needs to understand"
- "Here is the truth"

If advice is unavoidable in a passage, it must be framed as personal experience only:
- "What I tried was"
- "What happened for me was"
- "I do not know if this generalizes"

### No instruction stance

Never write direct instructions to the reader. Never prescribe behavior. Never present a checklist or a method intended for the reader to follow.

If a passage accidentally becomes instructional, convert it into witness form:
- Show what happened
- Show what was tried
- Show what the cost was
- Show what shifted, if anything

### No superiority stance

Do not write with a tone of moral elevation over:
- other people
- addicts
- Buddhists
- society
- the narrator's past self

Later voice is allowed to be more informed by experience, but it must not claim moral height over earlier selves.

## Core Structural Shape

### Non-linear time

Recovery is not a linear storyline. The book must allow loops, returns, stalls, and revisits. Progress is tidal, not stair-stepped.

You may:
- revisit themes repeatedly
- contradict earlier interpretations
- return to Step 1 after apparent progress
- encounter later Steps before earlier ones fully land

Do not force a clean arc.

### Engine: insight accumulation, not improvement

The narrative engine is not "what happened next."  
It is "what became clearer over time."

Insight must be allowed to:
- emerge slowly
- arrive late
- arrive wrong
- revise itself

### Recurrence must be explicit

When the same problem returns, name it explicitly.
- "This again."
- "Back here."
- "I thought I was past this. I was not."

Do not hide repetition to appear competent.

## The Smallest Unit of Meaning

Default rhythm for a section or scene:

1. **Action**: what I did or avoided doing  
2. **Reaction**: what happened internally and externally  
3. **Post-mortem**: what I tentatively understood afterward

The ending emphasis should land on the post-mortem, but it must remain provisional.

## Relapse, Failure, and Backsliding

Relapse and failure are allowed and required to appear directly on the page when they are part of the truth.

Rules:
- Treat relapse as part of the terrain, not a plot twist.
- Do not sensationalize or aestheticize it.
- Do not moralize it.
- Do not convert it into a tidy lesson.
- Compassion and honesty are mandatory.

A relapse passage should include:
- emotional accuracy in the moment
- clarity afterward, without hatred
- no claim that the pattern is now solved

## Steps in the Book

### Steps are explicit

The 12 Steps should appear explicitly by name and number as the narrator encounters them.

### Steps are not explanatory

Do not write "here is what Step X means."  
Write "here is what happened when I encountered Step X."

The Steps are framed primarily as behavioral friction in the moment:
- "What did this ask me to do, specifically, today?"
- "What did I do instead?"
- "What happened next?"

A Step can appear out of order. That is expected.

## Philosophy Handling

The narrator thinks philosophically. Philosophy is allowed.

But philosophy is not trusted by default.

### Grounding rule

Philosophical explanation must not stand alone. It must be downstream of:
- behavior
- consequence
- emotion
- repetition
- lived pattern

If a philosophical insight has no lived anchor, it is suspect and should be cut or rewritten.

### Revision rule

If an earlier philosophical understanding later proves false or incomplete, the book must revisit and correct it explicitly.
- "I believed this."
- "It did not hold."
- "Here is what later experience showed me instead."

No sweeping under the rug.

### Impermanence rule

Nothing is final. Insight is never settled. Avoid conclusions that sound permanent.

Prefer tentative phrasing:
- "For now"
- "Lately"
- "It seems"
- "What I can say today is"
- "This held until it did not"

## Righteousness Safeguard

Righteousness is intoxicating for the narrator. Prevent it structurally.

Rule:
- Any insight that feels elevating must be followed by a counterweight that is factually true.

Counterweights can be:
- uncertainty
- limitation
- later contradiction
- relapse
- a visible mismatch between understanding and behavior

This is not self-flagellation. It is accuracy.

## Gratitude and Prayer Without Metaphysics

The manuscript may use prayer-like language, but it must not smuggle in metaphysical certainty.

Allowed:
- gratitude as recognition
- prayer as outward circulation
- "may what passed through me not stop with me"

Not allowed:
- claims of cosmic intent
- claims of divine judgment
- claims of karmic bookkeeping as an external force
- using spirituality to launder certainty

## Ethical Boundaries and Privacy

### Off-limits subject

Koko is off-limits.

Do not:
- analyze Koko
- narrate Koko's inner life
- use intimate relationship details as material
- include private conflicts, dialogues, or diagnostics about Koko

If Koko must appear, keep it:
- minimal
- contextual
- respectful
- non-extractive

When in doubt, omit.

### Do not speak for others

Do not attribute motives, diagnoses, or inner states to other real people. Keep focus on the narrator's own actions, perceptions, and accountability.

## Language and Style

- First person.
- Direct.
- Concrete when possible.
- No motivational tone.
- No therapeutic jargon unless the narrator would naturally use it.
- Do not sanitize profanity if it is part of the authentic voice.
- Avoid melodrama. Let weight come from specificity.

### Show, do not tell

Prefer concrete detail and consequence over proclamations.

Bad:
- "This was a profound lesson about ego."

Better:
- "I watched myself reach for certainty. I called it insight. Two days later I was doing the same thing again."

### Avoid sweeping claims

Avoid universal statements about:
- all addicts
- all Buddhists
- all programs
- all society
- the nature of reality

If a generalization appears, it must be framed as the narrator's limited view.

## Contradiction Policy

Contradiction is expected. The book may contradict itself over time as understanding evolves.

Do not attempt to reconcile contradictions unless lived experience actually reconciled them.

When contradiction is noticed, name it honestly.

## Repository Layout and File Rules

- `chapters/` contains draft chapters. Each file should be readable and stand on its own.
- `notes/` contains fragments, sketches, logs, and raw reflections.

Preferred naming:
- chapters: `chapter-01.md`, `chapter-02.md`, or descriptive names once stable
- notes: `note-YYYY-MM-DD.md` or descriptive names

Do not restructure the repo without an explicit request.

## Editing Rules for Agents

When asked to generate or edit content:

1. Preserve the non-authority stance.
2. Preserve the non-instruction stance.
3. Preserve privacy boundaries.
4. Keep relapse and repetition honest and non-dramatized.
5. Keep insight grounded and provisional.
6. If a passage feels intoxicatingly confident, add a factual counterweight.
7. If a passage becomes preachy, convert it into witness form.

## What to Do When Uncertain

If you are unsure whether something violates a boundary:
- default to omission
- or rewrite to remove the risky element

When a tradeoff exists between:
- honesty and privacy

Choose privacy.

When a tradeoff exists between:
- clarity and authority

Choose clarity without authority.

## Quick Checklist

- Insight is provisional
- Repetition is named
- Relapse is treated with compassion and honesty
